# 📊 Admin Dashboard System (React + MUI)

A modern and responsive **Admin Dashboard** built using **React** and **Material UI (MUI)**.  
This project extends a UI-based tutorial by implementing **functional features**, including a **Notification System** and **Report Download functionality**, making the dashboard more interactive and practical.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Core Dashboard Features

- Responsive admin dashboard layout
- Light / Dark theme toggle
- Sidebar navigation
- Data tables using MUI DataGrid
- Charts and analytics components (Line, Bar, Geography)
- Search bar integration
- Stat boxes with progress indicators
- Geography-based traffic visualization

### 🔔 Notification Bar (Custom Feature)

Unlike the original tutorial which focused mainly on UI, this project includes a **functional notification bar**:

- Notification icon displayed in the top bar
- Clickable dropdown menu showing notifications
- Red indicator dot when notifications are available
- Notifications managed using React state
- Easily extendable to connect with backend or real-time updates

📌 **Why this matters:**  
This turns a static UI element into an **interactive system component**, improving usability and realism.

### 📥 Download Reports Feature (Custom Feature)

This project also includes a **report download feature**, which was **not part of the original tutorial**:

- Users can download reports directly from the dashboard
- Simulates real-world admin workflows (e.g. exporting data)
- Designed to be easily integrated with backend APIs or databases in the future

📌 **Why this matters:**  
It demonstrates **practical system functionality**, not just visual UI design.
